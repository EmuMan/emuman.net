It's like the song you'd expect to hear when you encounter a mysterious floating glow-y smoke-y thing in the woods at night or something. I used a whole tone scale to try to convey a sort of fantasy vibe for the whole thing. I actually based this off of an old sample I found of a vocal thing that I re-tuned to a single note and then put a crap ton of reverb on. I ran it through some granular synthesis, which is basically playing the sample from different points randomly to create like a whole bunch of the sound but all at different points in time, and then I played it really low and yeah. I hadn't really touched granular synthesis so it was pretty fun. The rest is mostly just ambient wind and chime noise I got off of a website and some extra noise to make the lead sound more breath-y.",

Unfortunately, the 3D assets were too big to be loaded onto the VR headset, but I was able to port the inputs to keyboard controls and the game ended up still being functional.',

All the audio is synchronized through Wwise, with smooth transitions between levels. The music was written by someone else in the project; I forgot their name, but I will update this if it gets back to me.",
