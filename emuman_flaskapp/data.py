The wah-sounding thing at the beginning was supposed to be a little fishy as well, I donâ€™t know why I made that correlation but hey I tried. The bells at the end were supposed to be underwater-y and smooth and stuff. I also drowned the whole thing in reverb (maybe a bit too much) and cut a lot of the high frequencies to add a little bit to the underwater feel."

It's like the song you'd expect to hear when you encounter a mysterious floating glow-y smoke-y thing in the woods at night or something. I used a whole tone scale to try to convey a sort of fantasy vibe for the whole thing. I actually based this off of an old sample I found of a vocal thing that I re-tuned to a single note and then put a crap ton of reverb on. I ran it through some granular synthesis, which is basically playing the sample from different points randomly to create like a whole bunch of the sound but all at different points in time, and then I played it really low and yeah. I hadn't really touched granular synthesis so it was pretty fun. The rest is mostly just ambient wind and chime noise I got off of a website and some extra noise to make the lead sound more breath-y."

It turned out more sneaky than I would have liked, although it still has some of that chunky quality I think. Maybe something bulky sneaking around? I don't know. Other than that I'm actually okay with how it turned out. Also sorry if the bass is too loud or quiet, it's pretty headphone-dependent unfortunately and I went on the louder side."

So I basically just took a kinda squeak-sounding lead and a fast-paced tempo to indicate something scurrying around, maybe running away from something, and went from there. And now I regret everything. I'm also fairly certain that I just completely copied the melody of some other random song out there. Either that or this is the most generic cartoon-y chase music ever written."
