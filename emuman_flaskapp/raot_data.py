        "question": "Why aren't there any titans?",
        "answer": "The lack of titans in the new game is a conscious decision made by the developers. This game is volunteer-run, and the amount of time and effort it would have taken to add titans was beyond the scope of this project. In short, the problem is more complicated than you might think."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will there be any more updates?",
        "answer": "There are currently no updates planned for the future. Everyone on the development team is taking a well-deserved break right now, and there is no guarantee that work will resume anytime soon, if at all. Again, this game is volunteer-run, so a limited amount of effort can be put into it."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the game free? I would pay for it.",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, due to the copyrighted material RAoT uses as a basis for gameplay, payment requirements are not legally an option. If you would like to support the developers, feel free to do so through the #donate channel in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Jc65tuT6vQ\" target=\"_blank\">Discord server</a>."

    {
        "question": "Why does the server browser keep failing to load?",
        "answer": "This is a known bug that is currently being looked into. It has to do with your game receiving malformed information from various online servers. For now, try leaving to the main menu and re-entering the server browser a few times. You can also try hosting a game, entering spectator mode, and leaving to see if that fixes the problem."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why am I getting an Online Play Warning?",
        "answer": "This issue is based on your wifi/router/hardware, unfortunately. You may try restarting various devices, but ultimately, you might have to contact a more specific service such as your ISP to resolve this problem."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do I keep getting kicked? My ping is fine.",
        "answer": "Some lobbies will kick you for having an unstable connection, even if your ping seems fine. This is to ensure that players are not frequently teleporting around lobbies. Unfortunately, this is made worse by the inconsistent nature of peer-to-peer networking. The best things you can try if you keep getting this issue are 1) searching for lobbies with a better connection to you, 2) searching for lobbies with no limit on unstable connections, and 3) hosting a server yourself."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I have to port forward or something?",
        "answer": "The game uses UPnP and NAT punchthrough to automatically allow your PC to be able to operate as a server. Manual port-forwarding is also an option. While we believe this should cover the majority of players, there will always be cases where certain routers won't cooperate, and for those users it may not be possible to host. Fortunately, you should still be able to join other games just fine."
